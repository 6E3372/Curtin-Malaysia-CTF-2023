## Solution

This is probably one of the weirdest yet not exactly the hardest OSINT challenge, so I started by looking around the Hotel in the google map, searching for nearby attractions, but none of it was correct. In the end I googled “Top attractions in Delhi” to find a tripadvisor website. That is where i manually bruteforce every single Location until i get the right one

The flag was No. 3 on the list which was Humayun’s Tomb

## Flag
